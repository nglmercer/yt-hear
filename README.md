    A youtube music client built with tauri.
</h4>


## Features
Slightly less memory usage compared to other YouTube music clients that displays https://music.youtube.com as their interface.

The app is electron-free so the installation size will be much smaller.
 
## Download
You can download executables from [releases]("./releases")

## Building
### Debian
I had to install these additional packages system-wide
* libssl-dev
* libwebkit2gtk-4.0-dev
* libjavascriptcoregtk-4.0-dev

## Contributions
Since YouTube Music itself is feature-complete as a web app, desktop application is not really needed. Still, there are some ideas:
* plugins
